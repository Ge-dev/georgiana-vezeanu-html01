    Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. 
    The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
    Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.

    Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to 
    emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups.
